# *IMPORTANT NOTE*: the server function (noserver=0) requires a network
#                   connection
#                   --> make sure that the module is loaded after the network
#                       interface
#                   One way of doing this is by declaring a (soft) module
#                   dependency to a specific network interface driver (see
#                   softdep feature below), another (more generic) would
#                   require explicit configuration via kmod/init/systemd.
#                   Alternatively, the module can be manually loaded with a
#                   batch file (i.e. rc.local script) that runs late(r) in the
#                   runlevel startup/boot process...

# *TODO*: this requires manual tailoring for the target system, i.e specifying
#         a valid network interface driver (could still be automated with sed
#         and similar tools)
# *NOTE*: works only for drivers compiled as modules
